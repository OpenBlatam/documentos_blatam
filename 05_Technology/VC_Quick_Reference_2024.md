Give options:

## üéØ QUICK WIN FORMULAS

### Valuation Formula
```
Base Multiple √ó (1 + AI Premium) √ó (1 + Growth Premium) √ó (1 + Market Timing)
= Final Valuation

Example:
20x √ó 1.3 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.1 = 34.3x ARR
```

### Dilution Formula
```
Investment Amount √∑ Post-Money Valuation = Dilution %

Example:
$5M √∑ $25M = 20% dilution
```

### LTV/CAC Formula
```
LTV = (ARPU √ó Gross Margin) √∑ Churn Rate
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend √∑ New Customers
LTV/CAC = LTV √∑ CAC

Target: 3x+ for SaaS, 5x+ for AI businesses
```
