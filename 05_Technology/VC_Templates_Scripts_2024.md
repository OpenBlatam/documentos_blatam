## 🎭 NEGOTIATION SCRIPTS

### Valuation Negotiation Scripts

#### Script 1: Countering Low Valuation
```
VC: "We're thinking $20M post-money"

YOU: "I appreciate you sharing that. Help me understand your thinking. 
What multiple or framework did you use to evaluate this?"

VC: [Explains their reasoning]

YOU: "That makes sense for a typical company at this stage. 
Let me show you why we're not typical:
[3 key differentiators]

Based on [comp 1] and [comp 2], we're targeting $30M post-money, 
which is actually conservative given [specific metric].

Where do you see the biggest risk that's creating the valuation gap?"

[Address their concern]

"If we can de-risk that, would $30M work?"
```

#### Script 2: Defending High Valuation
```
VC: "Your valuation seems high relative to comps"

YOU: "Let's dig into that. Which comps are you looking at?"

VC: [Names companies]

YOU: "Those are good comps for the market, but here's what's 
different about us:

1. [Comp 1] was growing X% when they raised. We're growing Y% (faster).
2. [Comp 2] had Z% gross margin. We have W% (better).
3. The AI premium in 2024 is adding 30-40% to valuations.

So while we're asking [X]x ARR, it's actually conservative given:
- Our faster growth
- Superior unit economics
- AI differentiation
- Market timing

That said, I'm open to discussing terms that work for both sides. 
What structure would make sense for you at this valuation?"

[Pivot to term negotiation]
```

### Term Sheet Negotiation Scripts

#### Script 3: Liquidation Preference
```
VC: "We want 2x participating liquidation preference"

YOU: "I understand you want downside protection. Let me explain 
why that doesn't work for us:

At a $100M exit, with 2x participating:
- You get $20M back first
- Then 20% of remaining $80M = $16M
- Total: $36M (36% of exit)
- We get: $64M (64% of exit)

With 1x non-participating:
- You get $20M OR 20% of $100M = $20M
- You choose the higher: $20M
- We get: $80M (80% of exit)

The difference is $16M to us. That's significant.

Can we find a middle ground? What about 1x participating?"
```

#### Script 4: Board Composition
```
VC: "We want 2 board seats out of 5"

YOU: "I understand you want board representation. Let me explain 
our thinking:

At this stage, we need:
- 2 founder seats (technical expertise)
- 1 investor seat (your expertise)
- 1 independent seat (neutral voice)
- Total: 4 seats

This gives you meaningful input while maintaining founder control 
during the critical growth phase.

As we scale, we can add more investor seats. But right now, 
founder control is essential for rapid decision-making.

Does that structure work for you?"
```

### Objection Handling Scripts

#### Script 5: "We need to see more traction"
```
VC: "We need to see more traction before investing"

YOU: "I appreciate you want to de-risk this. What specific 
metrics would give you confidence?"

VC: [Explains what they want to see]

YOU: "That makes sense. Here's the challenge: we're at the 
inflection point. The funds who win invest here, not later.

Look at the slope, not the absolute numbers. We're at [metric] 
and accelerating. At this trajectory, we'll be at [target metric] 
in 6 months.

Stripe was here when Sequoia invested. The question is timing, 
not potential.

If we can show [specific metric] by [date], would you be ready 
to invest?"
```

#### Script 6: "The market is too crowded"
```
VC: "The market is too crowded with competitors"

YOU: "You're right—there's a lot of activity in this space. 
What specifically concerns you about the competition?"

VC: [Explains concerns]

YOU: "A crowded market validates the opportunity size. 
The question is who wins.

Here's what no one else has: [unique advantage]

In network effect businesses, #1 takes 70% of value. 
Our retention/NPS/growth shows we're winning.

Does that address your competitive concerns?"
