Dear [Investor Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm [Your Name], founder and CEO of CopyCar.ai, and I'm reaching out because I believe our company aligns perfectly with your investment focus on [specific area].

**The Problem:** 85% of Latin American marketers are frustrated with AI tools that produce culturally tone-deaf content, wasting $150M annually and getting 3x lower engagement than culturally relevant content.

**The Solution:** CopyCar.ai is the first AI copywriting platform with Neural Marketing Consciousness that understands 15+ Latin American dialects, cultural nuances, and emotional context.

**The Results:** In just 6 months, we've grown to 150+ customers with $10K MRR, 25% monthly growth, and 75+ NPS scores. Our customers see 300% higher engagement and 450% ROI.

**The Opportunity:** We're targeting the $2.8B Latin American AI copywriting market with <1% penetration by specialized players.

I'd love to share more about how we're revolutionizing marketing in Latin America. Would you be available for a 15-minute call this week?
