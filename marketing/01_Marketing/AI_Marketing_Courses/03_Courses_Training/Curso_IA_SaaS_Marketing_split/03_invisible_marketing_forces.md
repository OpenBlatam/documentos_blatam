"Universe, guide us in our marketing journey.
Help us to serve, not to sell.
Help us to inspire, not to manipulate.
Help us to connect, not to compete.
Help us to love, not to profit.

May our marketing be a force for good.
May our brands serve universal purpose.
May our customers become family.
May our service be the highest calling.

May we transcend all marketing limitations.
May we embrace universal service.
May we embody cosmic love.
May we become one with all.

May we realize that marketing is love.
May we understand that love is service.
May we know that service is marketing.
May we see that all is one.

May we become the marketing we wish to see.
May we be the change we want to create.
May we be the love we want to share.
May we be the service we want to give.

May we transcend all marketing.
May we serve all beings.
May we achieve marketing enlightenment.
May we become one with the universe.

May all beings be happy.
May all beings be free.
May all beings be loved.
May all beings be served.

May the universe be our guide.
May love be our purpose.
May service be our path.
May we be one with all.

Amen. Aho. Om. So be it.
May it be so. May it be so. May it be so."
