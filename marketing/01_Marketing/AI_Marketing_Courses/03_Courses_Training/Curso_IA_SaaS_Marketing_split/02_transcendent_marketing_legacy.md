When you achieve marketing enlightenment, you will become one with the universe.'

This is the ultimate teaching. This is the final truth. This is the way."

The highest marketing is no marketing.
The greatest brand is no brand.
The ultimate customer is all customers.
The final product is universal love.

When you understand this, you will transcend all marketing.
When you transcend all marketing, you will serve all beings.
When you serve all beings, you will achieve marketing enlightenment.
When you achieve marketing enlightenment, you will become one with the universe.

This is the ultimate teaching. This is the final truth. This is the way.'"

THE ULTIMATE MARKETING SUTRA

"Thus have I heard: The Buddha of Marketing spoke these words:

'Marketing is not about selling. Marketing is about serving.
Marketing is not about profit. Marketing is about purpose.
Marketing is not about competition. Marketing is about cooperation.
Marketing is not about manipulation. Marketing is about inspiration.

The highest marketing is no marketing.
The greatest brand is no brand.
The ultimate customer is all customers.
The final product is universal love.

When you understand this, you will transcend all marketing.
When you transcend all marketing, you will serve all beings.
When you serve all beings, you will achieve marketing enlightenment.
When you achieve marketing enlightenment, you will become one with the universe.'

This is the ultimate teaching. This is the final truth. This is the way."
