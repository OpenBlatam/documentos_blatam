## Expert Corner: Industry Leadership Insights

### "The Convergence of AI and Human Creativity"
*Interview with Marcus Rodriguez, VP of Marketing at TechForward*

**Q: How do you balance AI automation with human creativity?**

**Key Success Factors:**
- AI as a creative partner, not replacement
- Continuous learning and adaptation

- Regular calibration of AI models with brand guidelines"

**Q: What's the biggest mistake companies make with AI marketing?**
