### **Template 7: Troubleshooting Guide**

#### **Common Issues and Solutions**
```
ISSUE: Low Intent Recognition Accuracy
SYMPTOMS:
- Chatbot frequently asks for clarification
- Users express frustration with responses
- High escalation rate

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Review training data quality
2. Check intent overlap and conflicts
3. Analyze user input patterns
4. Test with diverse user groups

SOLUTIONS:

- Improve entity extraction
- Implement fuzzy matching
- Add user feedback loop
- Retrain model with new data

PREVENTION:
- Regular model performance monitoring
- Continuous training data collection
- User feedback integration
- A/B testing for improvements

ISSUE: Slow Response Times
SYMPTOMS:
- Users waiting >5 seconds for responses
- High abandonment rate
- Poor user experience

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Check API response times
2. Monitor database query performance
3. Analyze network latency
4. Review server resource usage

SOLUTIONS:
