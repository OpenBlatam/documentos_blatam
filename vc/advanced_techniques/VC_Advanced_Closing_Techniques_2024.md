## 🧠 ADVANCED CLOSING PSYCHOLOGY

### The Psychology of Yes

#### 1. Commitment Escalation

Step 1: "Do you see the potential in this market?"
Step 2: "Would you be interested in learning more?"

Step 5: "Can we get a term sheet by Friday?"
```

**Why It Works**:
- Each yes makes the next yes easier

Don't let this be another one."
```

#### 3. Loss Aversion Activation

**The FOMO Close**:
```
"This is the last round at this valuation. 
Next round will be 3x higher based on our trajectory."

"We're only taking 2 more investors. 
After that, we're oversubscribed."

"The market window is closing. 
AI companies like ours won't be available at this price for long."
```

Given your investment thesis and our growth trajectory, 
which option makes more sense for you?"
```

**Why It Works**:
- Gives them control
- Both options benefit you
- Forces a decision

### Script 3: The Urgency Close

**When to Use**: Time-sensitive opportunity

**Script**:
```
"I need to be transparent with you. We have [X] other term sheets 
on the table, and we're making a decision by [date].

You're our top choice because [specific reasons],
