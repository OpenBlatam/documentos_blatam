- "Let me share some of the challenges we're facing"
- Result: More realistic expectations

WHEN VCs ARE TOO SKEPTICAL:
- Heat up with success stories
- "Let me show you what our customers are saying"
- Result: Increased confidence and interest

WHEN VCs ARE DISTRACTED:
- Create urgency and focus

Hi [Partner Name],

Thank you for the term sheet. We're excited about the potential partnership with [VC Firm] and appreciate the thoroughness of your proposal.

After careful review, we have a few points we'd like to discuss:

**Valuation & Economics:**
- We're targeting a pre-money valuation of $15M based on our current metrics and comparable companies
- The 1x non-participating liquidation preference works for us
- We'd like to discuss the option pool size and timing

**Governance:**
- We prefer a 3-2 board composition (3 founders, 2 investors) to maintain operational control
- We're comfortable with the protective provisions as outlined
- The information rights are reasonable

**Other Terms:**
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution is acceptable
- We'd like to clarify the drag-along and tag-along rights

We're also evaluating other term sheets and would like to move quickly to finalize terms. Would you be available for a call tomorrow to discuss these points?

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## 🎯 Negotiation Scripts

### 1. **Valuation Negotiation**

#### When Valuation is Too Low
```
VC: "We're offering a $10M pre-money valuation based on your current metrics."

You: "I appreciate the offer. Based on our research of comparable companies in the AI [education/marketing] space, we're seeing valuations in the $12-15M range for companies at our stage.

Our metrics support this:
- We're growing [X]% MoM vs. industry average of [Y]%
- Our gross margins are [X]% vs. industry average of [Y]%
- We have strong customer retention at [X]% vs. industry average of [Y]%

Given our traction and the competitive interest we're seeing, we're targeting $15M pre-money. However, we're open to discussing other terms that might make this work for both parties."

VC: "That's higher than we typically go for at this stage."

You: "I understand. What if we structured it differently? For example, we could do $12M pre-money with a 1.5x liquidation preference, or we could include an earn-out based on hitting specific milestones?

The key is finding a structure that works for both of us while reflecting the value we're creating."
```

### 2. **Board Control Negotiation**

#### When VCs Want Too Much Control
```
VC: "We'd like 3 board seats - 2 for us, 1 independent, and you keep 1."

You: "I appreciate your interest in being actively involved. However, given that we're still in the early stages of building the company, I'd prefer to maintain operational control with a 3-2 structure - 3 founders, 2 investors.

This allows us to:
- Move quickly on strategic decisions
- Maintain the entrepreneurial culture that's driving our growth
- Avoid potential conflicts between different investor interests

We're absolutely committed to regular board meetings, comprehensive reporting, and seeking your input on major decisions. But for day-to-day operations and strategic direction, I believe founder control is essential at this stage.

Would you be open to revisiting this in a future round when the company is more established?"
```

### 3. **Anti-dilution Negotiation**

#### When VCs Want Full Ratchet
```
VC: "We need full ratchet anti-dilution protection."

You: "I understand the need for protection, but full ratchet can be quite punitive to founders and employees.

What if we used broad-based weighted average instead? This provides protection while being more founder-friendly. It's the industry standard for most deals and strikes a fair balance.

Here's how it works:
- It considers the total number of shares outstanding
- It's less punitive than full ratchet
- It still provides meaningful protection in down rounds
- It's more aligned with long-term value creation

This approach is used by most top-tier VCs and would make it easier for us to attract future investors and employees. Would this work for you?"
```

### Emergency Scripts
```
WHEN VALUATION IS TOO LOW:
"I appreciate the offer, but based on our metrics and comparable companies, we're targeting $15M pre-money. Our growth rate, margins, and customer retention all support this valuation. However, I'm open to discussing other terms that might make this work for both parties."

WHEN BOARD CONTROL IS THREATENED:
"Given that we're still in the early stages of building the company, I believe founder control is essential for maintaining our entrepreneurial culture and moving quickly on strategic decisions. We're committed to regular board meetings and seeking your input, but for day-to-day operations, I need to maintain control."

WHEN PROCESS IS DRAGGING:
"We're excited about the potential partnership, but we need to move quickly to close this round. We have other interested parties and can't afford to let this drag on indefinitely. Can we set a firm timeline for next steps?"
