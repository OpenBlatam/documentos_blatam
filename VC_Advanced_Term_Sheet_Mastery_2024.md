## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Term Sheet Advantage

**Core Truth**: Terms often matter more than valuation. A well-negotiated term sheet can be worth millions more than a higher valuation with poor terms.

### Key Principles

1. **Terms > Price** - Sometimes better terms are worth more than higher valuation
2. **Package Negotiation** - Negotiate terms as a package, not individually
3. **Future Protection** - Consider how terms affect future rounds
4. **Exit Optimization** - Structure terms for optimal exit scenarios
5. **Relationship Balance** - Maintain partnership while protecting interests
