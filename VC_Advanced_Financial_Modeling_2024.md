## ðŸ’° REVENUE MODELS

### SaaS Revenue Models

#### Subscription Revenue

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**:
```
MRR = Number of Customers Ã— Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

Example:
1,000 customers Ã— $100/month = $100,000 MRR
```

**Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**:
```
ARR = MRR Ã— 12

Example:
$100,000 MRR Ã— 12 = $1,200,000 ARR
```

**Revenue Growth**:
```
Month-over-Month Growth = (Current MRR - Previous MRR) / Previous MRR

Example:
($120,000 - $100,000) / $100,000 = 20% MoM growth
```

#### Revenue Components

**New Revenue**:
- New customer acquisition
- New product sales
- Market expansion
- Price increases

**Expansion Revenue**:
- Upselling existing customers
- Cross-selling products
- Usage-based growth

### E-commerce Revenue Models

#### Transaction-Based Revenue

**Gross Merchandise Value (GMV)**:
```
GMV = Number of Transactions Ã— Average Order Value

Example:
10,000 transactions Ã— $50 AOV = $500,000 GMV
```

**Take Rate**:
```
Take Rate = Revenue / GMV

Example:
$50,000 revenue / $500,000 GMV = 10% take rate
```

**Revenue Calculation**:
```
Revenue = GMV Ã— Take Rate

Example:
$500,000 GMV Ã— 10% take rate = $50,000 revenue
```

#### Revenue Drivers

**Customer Acquisition**:
- Marketing spend
- Conversion rates
- Customer acquisition cost
- Lifetime value

**Order Frequency**:

### Marketplace Revenue Models

#### Commission-Based Revenue

**Commission Revenue**:
```
Commission Revenue = Transaction Volume Ã— Commission Rate

Example:

```

**Revenue Drivers**:
- Supply and demand
- Network effects
- Platform adoption
- Transaction frequency

**Growth Factors**:
- User acquisition

## ðŸ“ˆ UNIT ECONOMICS MASTERY

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

#### CAC Calculation

**Simple CAC**:
```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Number of New Customers

Example:
$100,000 spend / 500 customers = $200 CAC
```

**Blended CAC**:
```
Blended CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / Total New Customers

Includes all acquisition channels
```

**Paid CAC**:
```
Paid CAC = Paid Marketing Spend / Paid Customers

Excludes organic acquisition
```

#### CAC Optimization

**CAC Reduction Strategies**:
- Improve conversion rates
- Optimize marketing channels
- Increase organic acquisition
- Improve sales efficiency

**CAC Monitoring**:
- Track by channel
- Monitor trends
- Compare to benchmarks
- Optimize continuously

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

#### LTV Calculation

**Simple LTV**:
```
LTV = Average Revenue Per User Ã— Gross Margin Ã— Customer Lifespan

Example:
$100 ARPU Ã— 80% margin Ã— 24 months = $1,920 LTV
```

**Advanced LTV**:
```
LTV = (Monthly ARPU Ã— Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate

Example:
($100 Ã— 80%) / 5% = $1,600 LTV
```

**LTV with Growth**:
```
LTV = (ARPU Ã— Gross Margin) / (Churn Rate - Growth Rate)

Example:
($100 Ã— 80%) / (5% - 2%) = $2,667 LTV
```

#### LTV Optimization

**LTV Improvement Strategies**:
- Increase ARPU
- Improve gross margins
- Reduce churn
- Increase customer lifespan

**LTV Monitoring**:
- Track by segment
- Monitor trends
- Compare to benchmarks
- Optimize continuously

### LTV/CAC Ratio

#### Ratio Analysis

**Healthy Ratios**:
- SaaS: 3:1 to 5:1
- E-commerce: 2:1 to 4:1
- Marketplace: 2:1 to 3:1
- Industry dependent

**Ratio Interpretation**:
- < 1:1: Unsustainable
- 1:1 to 2:1: Marginal
- 2:1 to 3:1: Good
- 3:1+: Excellent

#### Payback Period

**Payback Calculation**:
```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly ARPU Ã— Gross Margin)

Example:
$200 CAC / ($100 Ã— 80%) = 2.5 months
```

**Target Payback Periods**:
- SaaS: 6-12 months
- E-commerce: 3-6 months
- Marketplace: 6-12 months
- Industry dependent

## ðŸ’Ž VALUATION MODELS

### DCF Model

#### DCF Components

**Free Cash Flow**:
```
FCF = EBIT Ã— (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in Working Capital

Example:
$1M EBIT Ã— (1 - 25%) + $200K - $300K - $100K = $550K FCF
```

**Terminal Value**:
```
Terminal Value = Final Year FCF Ã— (1 + Growth Rate) / (WACC - Growth Rate)

Example:
$1M Ã— (1 + 3%) / (12% - 3%) = $11.4M Terminal Value
```

**Present Value**:
```
PV = FCF / (1 + WACC)^Year

Example:
$550K / (1 + 12%)^1 = $491K PV
```

#### WACC Calculation

**Cost of Equity**:
```
Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta Ã— Market Risk Premium

Example:
3% + 1.5 Ã— 7% = 13.5%
```

**Cost of Debt**:
```
Cost of Debt = Interest Rate Ã— (1 - Tax Rate)

Example:
8% Ã— (1 - 25%) = 6%
```

**WACC**:
```
WACC = (Equity / Total Capital) Ã— Cost of Equity + (Debt / Total Capital) Ã— Cost of Debt

Example:
(80% Ã— 13.5%) + (20% Ã— 6%) = 12%
```

### Comparable Company Model

#### Multiple Selection

**Revenue Multiples**:
- EV/Revenue
- Price/Sales
- Industry specific

**EBITDA Multiples**:
- EV/EBITDA
- Price/EBITDA
- Profitability adjusted
- Growth adjusted

**Other Multiples**:
- EV/EBIT
- Price/Earnings
- Book value multiples
- Asset multiples

#### Multiple Application

**Revenue Multiple**:
```
Valuation = Revenue Ã— Revenue Multiple

Example:
$10M revenue Ã— 8x multiple = $80M valuation
```

**EBITDA Multiple**:
```
Valuation = EBITDA Ã— EBITDA Multiple

Example:
$2M EBITDA Ã— 15x multiple = $30M valuation
```

### Venture Capital Method

#### VC Method Steps

**Exit Value Estimation**:
```
Exit Value = Exit Revenue Ã— Exit Multiple

Example:
$100M revenue Ã— 5x multiple = $500M exit value
```

**Required Return**:
```
Required Return = (Exit Value / Current Value)^(1/Years) - 1

Example:
($500M / $50M)^(1/5) - 1 = 58% required return
```

**Ownership Calculation**:
```
Ownership = Investment / (Exit Value / Required Return)

Example:
$5M / ($500M / 3x) = 30% ownership
```
