## 1. Understanding Customer Re-engagement

### 1.1 What is Customer Re-engagement?

Customer re-engagement is the process of reactivating customers who have become inactive or dormant. These are customers who:
- Haven't made a purchase in a specified period (typically 3+ months)
- Have reduced their engagement with your brand
- Show signs of potential churn

**Why is it important?**
- Acquiring new customers costs 5-25x more than retaining existing ones
- Inactive customers represent significant untapped revenue potential
- Re-engagement campaigns typically have higher ROI than acquisition campaigns

### 1.2 The Customer Lifecycle

Understanding where customers are in their lifecycle is crucial for effective re-engagement:

```
New Customer â†’ Active Customer â†’ At-Risk Customer â†’ Inactive Customer â†’ Lost Customer
     â†“              â†“                â†“                 â†“              â†“
  Welcome        Regular         Re-engagement    Re-engagement   Win-back
  Campaigns      Campaigns       Campaigns        Campaigns       Campaigns
```

**Key Stages:**
- **New Customer (0-30 days)**: Welcome and onboarding
- **Active Customer (30+ days)**: Regular engagement and upselling
- **At-Risk Customer (60+ days inactive)**: Early intervention
- **Inactive Customer (90+ days inactive)**: Re-engagement campaigns
- **Lost Customer (180+ days inactive)**: Win-back campaigns

### 1.3 Common Reasons for Customer Inactivity

**Price Sensitivity:**
- Customers waiting for discounts or sales

- Poor customer service experience
