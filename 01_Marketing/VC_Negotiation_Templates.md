### 3. Term Sheet Response

```
Subject: Re: Term Sheet - [Company Name] Series A

Hi [Partner Name],

Thank you for the term sheet. We're excited about the potential partnership with [VC Firm] and appreciate the thoroughness of your proposal.

After careful review, we have a few points we'd like to discuss:

**Valuation & Economics:**
- We're targeting a pre-money valuation of $15M based on our current metrics and comparable companies
- The 1x non-participating liquidation preference works for us
- We'd like to discuss the option pool size and timing

**Governance:**
- We prefer a 3-2 board composition (3 founders, 2 investors) to maintain operational control
- We're comfortable with the protective provisions as outlined
- The information rights are reasonable

**Other Terms:**
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution is acceptable
- We'd like to clarify the drag-along and tag-along rights

We're also evaluating other term sheets and would like to move quickly to finalize terms. Would you be available for a call tomorrow to discuss these points?

Looking forward to your response.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Negotiation Scripts

### 1. Valuation Negotiation

```
VC: "We're offering a $10M pre-money valuation based on your current metrics."

You: "I appreciate the offer. Based on our research of comparable companies in the AI marketing space, we're seeing valuations in the $12-15M range for companies at our stage. 

Our metrics support this:
- We're growing 20% MoM vs. industry average of 10%
- Our gross margins are 90% vs. industry average of 75%
- We have strong customer retention at 95% vs. industry average of 85%

Given our traction and the competitive interest we're seeing, we're targeting $15M pre-money. However, we're open to discussing other terms that might make this work for both parties."

VC: "That's higher than we typically go for at this stage."

You: "I understand. What if we structured it differently? For example, we could do $12M pre-money with a 1.5x liquidation preference, or we could include an earn-out based on hitting specific milestones? 

The key is finding a structure that works for both of us while reflecting the value we're creating."
```

### 2. Board Control Negotiation

```
VC: "We'd like 3 board seats - 2 for us, 1 independent, and you keep 1."

You: "I appreciate your interest in being actively involved. However, given that we're still in the early stages of building the company, I'd prefer to maintain operational control with a 3-2 structure - 3 founders, 2 investors.

This allows us to:
- Move quickly on strategic decisions
- Maintain the entrepreneurial culture that's driving our growth
- Avoid potential conflicts between different investor interests

We're absolutely committed to regular board meetings, comprehensive reporting, and seeking your input on major decisions. But for day-to-day operations and strategic direction, I believe founder control is essential at this stage.

Would you be open to revisiting this in a future round when the company is more established?"
```

### 3. Anti-dilution Negotiation

```
VC: "We need full ratchet anti-dilution protection."

You: "I understand the need for protection, but full ratchet can be quite punitive to founders and employees. 

What if we used broad-based weighted average instead? This provides protection while being more founder-friendly. It's the industry standard for most deals and strikes a fair balance.

Here's how it works:
- It considers the total number of shares outstanding
- It's less punitive than full ratchet
- It still provides meaningful protection in down rounds
- It's more aligned with long-term value creation

This approach is used by most top-tier VCs and would make it easier for us to attract future investors and employees. Would this work for you?"
