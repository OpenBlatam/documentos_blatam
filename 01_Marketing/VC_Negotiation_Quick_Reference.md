## 📞 Emergency Scripts

### When Valuation is Too Low
"I appreciate the offer, but based on our metrics and comparable companies, we're targeting $15M pre-money. Our growth rate, margins, and customer retention all support this valuation. However, I'm open to discussing other terms that might make this work for both parties."

### When Board Control is Threatened
"Given that we're still in the early stages of building the company, I believe founder control is essential for maintaining our entrepreneurial culture and moving quickly on strategic decisions. We're committed to regular board meetings and seeking your input, but for day-to-day operations, I need to maintain control."

### When Process is Dragging
"We're excited about the potential partnership, but we need to move quickly to close this round. We have other interested parties and can't afford to let this drag on indefinitely. Can we set a firm timeline for next steps?"
