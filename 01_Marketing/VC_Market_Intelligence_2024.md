## 🎯 Remember: Intelligence is Power

The best negotiators understand that information is power. Master the intelligence gathering, and you'll master the negotiation. But remember: the goal isn't to overwhelm with data - it's to demonstrate expertise and create competitive advantage.

**The most successful founders are those who understand both their market and their VCs better than anyone else. Master both, and you'll not just raise money - you'll build the relationships that will help you build something extraordinary.**
