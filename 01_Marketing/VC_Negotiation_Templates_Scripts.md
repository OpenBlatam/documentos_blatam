## 🎯 Negotiation Scripts

### 1. **Valuation Negotiation**

#### When Valuation is Too Low
```
VC: "We're offering a $10M pre-money valuation based on your current metrics."

You: "I appreciate the offer. Based on our research of comparable companies in the AI [education/marketing] space, we're seeing valuations in the $12-15M range for companies at our stage.

Our metrics support this:
- We're growing [X]% MoM vs. industry average of [Y]%
- Our gross margins are [X]% vs. industry average of [Y]%
- We have strong customer retention at [X]% vs. industry average of [Y]%

Given our traction and the competitive interest we're seeing, we're targeting $15M pre-money. However, we're open to discussing other terms that might make this work for both parties."

VC: "That's higher than we typically go for at this stage."

You: "I understand. What if we structured it differently? For example, we could do $12M pre-money with a 1.5x liquidation preference, or we could include an earn-out based on hitting specific milestones?

The key is finding a structure that works for both of us while reflecting the value we're creating."
```

#### When Valuation is Reasonable
```
VC: "We're offering a $15M pre-money valuation."

You: "That's in line with our expectations based on our metrics and comparable companies. I appreciate you recognizing the value we've built.

A few questions about the other terms:
- What's your thinking on board composition?
- How do you typically structure liquidation preferences?
- What's your approach to option pools?

We're excited about the potential partnership and want to make sure we're aligned on the key terms."
```

### 2. **Board Control Negotiation**

#### When VCs Want Too Much Control
```
VC: "We'd like 3 board seats - 2 for us, 1 independent, and you keep 1."

You: "I appreciate your interest in being actively involved. However, given that we're still in the early stages of building the company, I'd prefer to maintain operational control with a 3-2 structure - 3 founders, 2 investors.

This allows us to:
- Move quickly on strategic decisions
- Maintain the entrepreneurial culture that's driving our growth
- Avoid potential conflicts between different investor interests

We're absolutely committed to regular board meetings, comprehensive reporting, and seeking your input on major decisions. But for day-to-day operations and strategic direction, I believe founder control is essential at this stage.

Would you be open to revisiting this in a future round when the company is more established?"
```

#### When Board Composition is Reasonable
```
VC: "We'd like 2 board seats - 1 for us, 1 independent, and you keep 2."

You: "That works well for us. We value your strategic input and want to make sure we have the right governance structure.

A few thoughts on the independent board member:
- We'd like someone with [specific expertise]
- Someone who can help with [specific area]
- Ideally someone who's been through [specific experience]

Do you have any suggestions for independent board members who might be a good fit?"
```

### 3. **Anti-dilution Negotiation**

#### When VCs Want Full Ratchet
```
VC: "We need full ratchet anti-dilution protection."

You: "I understand the need for protection, but full ratchet can be quite punitive to founders and employees.

What if we used broad-based weighted average instead? This provides protection while being more founder-friendly. It's the industry standard for most deals and strikes a fair balance.

Here's how it works:
- It considers the total number of shares outstanding
- It's less punitive than full ratchet
- It still provides meaningful protection in down rounds
- It's more aligned with long-term value creation

This approach is used by most top-tier VCs and would make it easier for us to attract future investors and employees. Would this work for you?"
```

#### When Anti-dilution is Reasonable
```
VC: "We'd like broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection."

You: "That's exactly what we were hoping for. It provides protection while being founder-friendly.

A few clarifications:
- Should we exclude the option pool from the calculation?
- What about exceptions for down rounds below a certain threshold?
- How do you typically handle employee option grants?

We want to make sure we're aligned on the details so there are no surprises later."
```
