## üéØ Remember: Terms Matter

The best negotiators understand that terms are just as important as valuation. Master the terms, and you'll not just raise money - you'll build the foundation for long-term success.

**The most successful founders are those who negotiate both valuation and terms effectively. Master both, and you'll have the foundation to build something extraordinary.**
