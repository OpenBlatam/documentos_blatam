- Problem-solving

## Types of AI

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed for specific tasks
- Most common type today
- Examples: Siri, Google Translate, recommendation systems

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
- Human-level intelligence across all domains
- Still theoretical
- Can perform any intellectual task a human can

### 3. Super AI
- Surpasses human intelligence
- Hypothetical future state
- Could solve problems beyond human capability
