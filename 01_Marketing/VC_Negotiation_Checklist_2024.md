## ðŸŽ¯ Remember: Preparation is Everything

The best negotiators are the most prepared. Use this checklist as your foundation, but remember to customize your approach for each specific situation and VC.

**The most successful founders are those who understand that negotiation is about partnership, not just fundraising. Master the preparation, and you'll master the negotiation.**

*This checklist should be used ethically and responsibly. The goal is to create win-win outcomes that benefit both founders and investors, not to manipulate or deceive.*
