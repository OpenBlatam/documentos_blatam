*"Good morning. I'm here to present a revolutionary AI marketing platform that's solving the $200 billion problem of ineffective marketing automation. While Jasper and Copy.ai are generating $125M and $50M ARR respectively, they're missing the critical element that drives 10x better results: consciousness-based AI.
