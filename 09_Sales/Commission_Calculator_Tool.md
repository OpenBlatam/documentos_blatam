## CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: New SMB Deal
```
Deal Value: $60,000 annually
Base Rate: 25%
Partner Tier: Silver (1.1x multiplier)
Fast Close Bonus: 10%

Calculation:
Base Commission: $60,000 × 25% = $15,000
Tier Multiplier: $15,000 × 1.1 = $16,500
Fast Close Bonus: $16,500 × 10% = $1,650
Total Commission: $16,500 + $1,650 = $18,150
```

### Example 2: Enterprise Deal
```
Deal Value: $300,000 annually
Base Rate: 30%
Partner Tier: Gold (1.2x multiplier)
New Market Bonus: 15%

Calculation:
Base Commission: $300,000 × 30% = $90,000
Tier Multiplier: $90,000 × 1.2 = $108,000
New Market Bonus: $108,000 × 15% = $16,200
Total Commission: $108,000 + $16,200 = $124,200
```

### Example 3: Recurring Commission (Year 2)
```
Original Deal Value: $100,000 annually
Original Commission Rate: 25%
Year 2 Rate: 12.5% (50% of original)
Partner Tier: Silver (1.1x multiplier)

Calculation:
Year 2 Commission: $100,000 × 12.5% = $12,500
Tier Multiplier: $12,500 × 1.1 = $13,750
Total Year 2 Commission: $13,750
